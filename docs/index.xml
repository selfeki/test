      <description>Lazy-Jar is a slack app for scheduling remote stand-ups and tracking participation
Simply create a stand-up with the following example:
/lj schedule myStandUp with @shaniqua and @batman everyday at 10 am UTC
Once a stand-up is created, Lazy-Jar will notify all stand-up members 5 minutes prior the start of every stand-up by sending them a link to a video chatroom. Lazy-Jar tracks member participation by keeping track of which of the links it had sent were clicked on.</description>
